### Introduction:
I created this personal project to better understand my spending patterns and preferences in restaurants and dishes. I hope to curb my spending going forward and maybe have a real shot at eating healthy. Sorry, Zomato!

The project is being processed, and I aim to answer the following questions.

### Questions to be answered:
#### Restaurant Preferences:
1. Top restaurants ordered from
2. Restaurants least ordered from
3. Restaurants ordered from, spread across a typical week
4. Average per-order value per restaurant
5. Distance of the restaurant from home
6. Am I indifferent to delivery charges?

#### Dish Preferences:
1. Most ordered to least ordered dishes
2. Price range of orders
3. Dishes ordered spread across a typical week
4. Do I like a dish so much as to ignore the price?
5. Did I order any healthy dishes?

#### Aligning my order history with my menstrual cycle, what are the observed patterns?
#### How much have I spent in total, and how much have I spent on delivery charges alone during this study period?
#### Did switching to Zomato Gold benefit me in terms of prices?
#### How much money did I save using Zomato Gold's discount coupons?
#### Attempt to predict my spending and my dish preference for the next month
