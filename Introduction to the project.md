Hello!
Welcome to my blasphemous Zomato order history. I have created this personal project to better understand my spending patterns, my preferences in restaurants and dishes so as to curb my spending going forward and maybe have a real shot at eating healthy. Sorry, Zomato!

The project is currently under process and I aim to answer the following questions.

### Restaurant Preferences:
1. Top restaurants ordered from
2. Restaurants least ordered from
3. Restaurants ordered from, spread across a typical week
4. Average per order value per restaurant
5. Distance of restaurant from home
6. Am I indifferent to delivery charges?

### Dish Preferences:
1. Most ordered to least ordered dishes
2. Price range of orders
3. Dishes ordered spread across a typical week
4. Do I like a dish so much as to ignore the price?
5. Did I order any healthy dishes?

### Aligning my order history with my menstrual cycle, what are the observed patterns?
### How much have I spent in total and how much have I spent on delivery charges alone during this studied period?
### Did switching to Zomato Gold benefit me in terms of prices?
### How much money did I save using Zomato Gold's discount coupons?
### Attempt to predict my spendings and my dish preference for the next month
